This project aims at finding the dependency among various classes in an application, and using that dependency graph to
find the test cases that need to be re-run from a Test Suite if changes are made to a certain class. The overall benefit
is that all test cases need not be run after making changes to any class, and the regression test effort is significantly reduced.

To run the application, run DevendencyView as a Java Application in Eclipse.
